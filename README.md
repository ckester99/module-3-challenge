## Purpose

This is a weekly coding challenge for the UNCC full stack bootcamp. The assignment was to add a javascript function that uses window
prompts to ask the user for parameters about the password they want, then generates and displays a randomly generated password from the
valid character sets the user specified.

I also sanitized the user input by forcing them to respond to each prompt with a y or n and prompting them again if they failed to respond
correctly.

Additionally, I added logic to skip the current prompt and not display the remaining prompts if the user clicks cancel so the browser
does not trap the user with a prompt window open.
